  <h2>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
  
  <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
  
  <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
  
  <h2>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
  
  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
  
  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
  
  <h2>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
  
  <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
  
  <h2>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@bertieapp.com">help@bertieapp.com</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information.</em></p>
  
  <p>Depending on your geographic location, applicable privacy law may mean you have certain rights regarding your personal information. Learn more about your privacy rights.</p>
  
  <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
  
  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
  
  <h2>13. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
  
  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you are a resident of certain US states, you may have specific rights regarding your personal information.</em></p>
  
  <p>If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have specific rights regarding your personal information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
  
  <p>You have rights under certain US state data protection laws. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. These rights include:</p>

  </ul>
  
  <p>Depending upon the state where you live, you may also have the following rights:</p>

  <p><strong>Request Verification</strong></p>
  
  <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
  
  <p>If you submit the request through an authorised agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>
  
  <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@bertieapp.com">help@bertieapp.com</a>. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.</p>
